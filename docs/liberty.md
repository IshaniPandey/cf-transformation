# IBM WebSphere Liberty

The liberty tool generates the following configuration files:

- server.xml (new or modified from existing)
- runtime-vars.xml (extracted environment variables from VCAP_SERVICES)

You may want to modify the runtime-vars.xml manually as necessary to attach to different backend services.
